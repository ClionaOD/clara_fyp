## REPO DATA DEPENDENCIES

atlases/ -> this directory should have brain parcellation files, in our various age spaces.

-   I'm currently pushing these using Git (1.5 Mb), but if file sizes increase we should review.

registration/ -> this is where registration scripts and resulting warp files are stored.

-   due to large file size, only the code is being synced using Git and output files must be acquired elsewhere.

templates/ -> these are the anatomical templates.

-   I'm currently pushing these using Git (30 Mb), but if file sizes increase we should review.
